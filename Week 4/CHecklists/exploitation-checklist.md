# Advanced Exploitation Lab – Checklist

Target: Mr. Robot (VulnHub)  
Attacker Host: Kali Linux  
Objective: Perform full exploitation chain (Recon → Foothold → Priv-Esc → Advanced PoC → ROP ASLR Bypass)

---

## 1. Pre-Engagement

- [ ] Environment isolated (VM/Lab)
- [ ] Target IP identified
- [ ] Network connectivity confirmed
- [ ] Notes & logs directory created
- [ ] Screenshots recording enabled

---

## 2. Reconnaissance

### Passive Recon

- [ ] Ping sweep/host discovery
- [ ] OS fingerprinting

### Active Recon

- [ ] Full scan → `nmap -A -sC -sV <IP>`
- [ ] Vulnerability scan → `nmap --script vuln <IP>`
- [ ] Web enumeration → `gobuster/dirb`
- [ ] WordPress scan → `wpscan`
- [ ] Banner + service fingerprinting

---

## 3. Initial Foothold

### Manual

- [ ] Access WordPress
- [ ] Upload PHP reverse shell in theme editor (404.php or template file)
- [ ] Setup listener → `nc -lvnp <port>`
- [ ] Trigger URL and receive shell

### Automated

- [ ] `msfconsole`
- [ ] `use unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload`
- [ ] Set RHOSTS, USERNAME, PASSWORD
- [ ] Run exploit → Meterpreter gained

---

## 4. Lateral Movement

- [ ] Enumerate sensitive files
- [ ] Found `password.raw-md5`
- [ ] Crack hash with John/Hashcat
- [ ] Switch to user `robot`

---

## 5. Privilege Escalation

- [ ] Enumerate system
- [ ] `nmap --interactive` privilege exploit
- [ ] `!sh` → Root access obtained
- [ ] Validate `whoami`, `id`

---

## 6. Advanced Lab Tasks

### Custom PoC (Buffer Overflow)

- [ ] Download exploit-db PoC (Python)
- [ ] Modify offset/payload
- [ ] Replace payload with reverse shell
- [ ] Execute & validate exploitation

### ROP + ASLR Bypass

- [ ] Analyze binary in Ghidra
- [ ] Extract gadgets via ROPgadget
- [ ] Build ROP chain calling `mprotect()`
- [ ] Inject shellcode → Shell spawn

---

## 7. Documentation & Reporting

- [ ] Logs maintained
- [ ] Screenshots captured
- [ ] Exploit chain table created
- [ ] Final PDF report prepared

---
