# 💥 Exploit Validation Summary – Week 2

During the exploitation and validation phase, multiple controlled attack techniques were executed against lab systems such as DVWA and Metasploitable2. Using Metasploit’s `exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_login`, a successful remote code execution was achieved through weak Tomcat Manager credentials, resulting in a remote shell session. SQL injection vulnerabilities in DVWA were validated using sqlmap, confirming database extraction capability. Burp Suite was utilized for intercepting requests, identifying insecure parameters, and verifying XSS payload execution. Each exploit was documented with logs, screenshots, and CVE references from Exploit-DB to confirm authenticity and applicability. Validation ensured that identified vulnerabilities were exploitable, reproducible, and aligned with real-world attack patterns before proceeding to post-exploitation tasks.
