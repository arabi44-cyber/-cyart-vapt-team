# 📝 Non-Technical Brief – Week 2

This assessment focused on identifying and validating security weaknesses in a controlled laboratory environment to simulate real-world cyber threats. The process involved scanning systems for vulnerabilities, analyzing publicly available information, and attempting safe exploitation to understand the potential risks. Findings included outdated software versions, exposed network services, weak authentication mechanisms, and web application flaws that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access. Each issue was evaluated for impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The report recommends timely patching, secure configuration, service hardening, and improved monitoring to reduce exposure. This assessment demonstrates how adversaries might compromise systems and provides a roadmap for strengthening security defenses in practical deployments.
