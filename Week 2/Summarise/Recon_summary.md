# 🔍 Reconnaissance Summary – Week 2

The reconnaissance phase focused on gathering publicly accessible information to understand the target environment before active engagement. WHOIS lookups were used to collect domain registration details, administrative contacts, and DNS information. Subdomain enumeration with Sublist3r revealed multiple additional entry points that were not visible from the main domain. Shodan scanning identified exposed services such as SSH, HTTP, and outdated server banners that may indicate vulnerable versions. Maltego allowed deeper mapping of digital relationships, including connected domains, emails, and potential infrastructure components. Wappalyzer helped determine the technology stack, including CMS, frameworks, and server types. These combined insights supported targeted vulnerability scanning and helped identify high-value assets for the exploitation phase.
